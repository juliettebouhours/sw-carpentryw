-->git init : launch the version control
-->git status : gives you the status of the files thatt are staged/tracked or untracked by git
-->git add : add a specific file to the git directory and then this files starts begin tracked by git version control
  rk: instead of the name of the file you can put . and then it will add the entire directory to the git directory
git commit -m "comments related to the changes done" : submit the changes done to all the files you added to the git directory with the comment in ""

If you change one of the file in the git directory and you want to submit the changes then you need to first
1) add this new version to the directory
2) commit the changes with some comments
==>
-->git add nameofthefile
-->git commit -m "comments"

then to see all the different changes:
-->git log

if you have not submit the changes yet (using the command add and commit) 
you can see the difference between the older version (stored in git) 
and this new version with:
-->git diff nameoffile

If you want to submit changes for a bunch of different files that you made within your current directory
you can use the shortcut . when adding (git add .) 
and it will add only the files that were changed. 
Then you can commit

If you remode a file and want it to be submit to git version control
Then after removing this file use the command
-->git add --all .
And the deleted file is added to the tracked file
To submit the changes then as usual 
-->git commit -m "comments" 

To compare the current version of a file with a previous one (the nth previous here) 
-->git diff HEAD~n nameoffile
